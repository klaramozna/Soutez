                <h1>Mercury</h1>
                <p><strong><em>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and is also the smallest 
                    of the eight planets in our solar system. For every 2 orbits of the Sun, which takes around 
                    88 Earth days, Mercury completes three rotations of its axis. It is gravitationally locked 
                    and this rotation is unique to the solar system.</em></strong></p>

                <ul class="smaller">
                    <li>Mercury has been known to humanity since ancient times and although its discovery date is unknown, the first 
                        mentions of the planet are believed to be around 3000 BC by the Sumerians.</li>
                    <li>A year in Mercury is 88 days, yet a Mercury day is 176 Earth days. Mercury is nearly tidally locked to the Sun – 
                        also known as a gravitational lock – and over time this has slowed the rotation of the planet to almost match its 
                        orbit around the Sun.</li>
                    <li>Mercury orbits so quickly around the Sun that early civilizations believed it was actually two different stars – 
                        one which appeared in the morning and another which appeared in the evening.</li>
                    <li>Mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system with a diameter of 4,879 km and is one of five planets that is visible 
                        to the naked eye.</li>
                    <li>After the Earth, Mercury is the second densest planet. Despite its small size, Mercury is very dense because it is composed
                         mainly of heavy metals and rock – the main characteristic of terrestrial planets.</li>
                    <li>Mercury is named after the messenger of the Roman gods, who is also known as Hermes in Greek mythology. This is because of 
                        the speed in which Mercury orbits the Sun and the speed with which Mercury the Roman deity was able to deliver messages.</li>
                    <li>Astronomers didn’t realize that Mercury was a planet until 1543 when Copernicus published his Sun-centered model of the Solar 
                        System – putting the Sun as the centre of the solar system rather than the previously believed centre, the Earth.</li>
                    <li>The planet has just 38% of the gravity on Earth. This means that Mercury isn’t able to hold the atmosphere it has and it instead
                        gets blown away by solar winds. However those same solar winds are also bringing in new gases, radioactive decay and dust from 
                        micrometeorites – replenishing the atmosphere.</li>
                </ul>
