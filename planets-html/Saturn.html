                <h1>Saturn</h1>
                <strong><em><p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and second largest planet of the Solar 
                    System in terms of diameter and mass. If compared, it is easy to see why Saturn and Jupiter 
                    have been designated as relatives. From atmospheric composition to rotation, these two planets are 
                    extremely similar. Because of these factors, Saturn was named after the father of the god Jupiter 
                    in Roman mythology.</p></em></strong>

                <ul class="smaller">
                    <li>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun, and last of the planets known to ancient civilizations. 
                        It was known to the Babylonians and Far Eastern observer.</li>
                    <li>Saturn is one of five planets able to be seen with the naked eye. It is also the fifth brightest object 
                        in the solar system.</li>
                    <li>In Roman mythology Saturn was the father of Jupiter, king of the gods. This relationship makes sense 
                        given that the planets Saturn and Jupiter are similar in so many respects, including size and composition. 
                        The Greek counterpart is known as Cronus.</li>
                    <li>The most common nickname for Saturn is “The Ringed Planet”, a nickname arising from the large, 
                        beautiful and extensive ring system that encircles the planet. These rings are mostly made from chunks 
                        of ice and carbonaceous dust. They stretch out more than 12,700 km from the planet but are only a mere 20 
                        meters thick.</li>
                    <li>Saturn gives off more energy than it receives from the Sun. This unusual quality is believed to be generated 
                        from the gravitational compression of the planet combined with the friction from large amount of helium 
                        found within its atmosphere.</li>
                    <li>It takes Saturn 29.4 Earth years to orbit the Sun. This slow movement against a backdrop of stars 
                        led to the planet being nicknamed “Lubadsagush” – or “oldest of the old” – by the ancient 
                        Assyrians.</li>
                    <li>Saturn has the fastest winds of any other planet in our solar system. These winds have been 
                        measured at approximately 1,800 km per hour (1,100 miles per hour).</li>
                    <li>Saturn is the least dense planet in the solar system. It is made mostly of hydrogen and has a density 
                        which is less than water – which technically means that Saturn would float. The layers of hydrogen 
                        get denser further into the planet, eventually becoming metallic and leading to a hot interior core.</li>
                    <li>Saturn has 150 moons and smaller moonlets. All of these moons are frozen – the largest of which are 
                        Titan and Rhea. The moon Enceladus also appears to have an ocean hidden below its frozen surface.</li>
                    <li>Saturn’s moon Titan is the second largest moon in the Solar System, behind Jupiter’s moon 
                        Ganymede. It has a complex and dense atmosphere made mostly of nitrogen and is composed from water ice 
                        and rock. The frozen surface of Titan has liquid methane lakes and a landscape which is covered with 
                        frozen nitrogen. It is possible that Titan may be a harbour for life – but that life would not be 
                        similar to life on Earth.</li>
