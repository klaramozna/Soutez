                <h1>Mars</h1>
                <strong><em><p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and last of the terrestrial planets. Like the 
                    rest of the planets in the solar system (except Earth), Mars is named after a mythological 
                    figure - the Roman god of war. In addition to its official name, Mars is sometimes called the 
                    Red Planet because of the brownish-red color of its surface. Mars is the second smallest planet 
                    in the solar system behind Mercury.</p></em></strong>

                <ul class="smaller">
                    <li>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and last of the terrestrial planets and is around 227,940,000 km from the Sun.</li>
                    <li>The planet is named after Mars, the Roman god of war. It was known to the ancient Greeks as Ares, their god of war. 
                        This is thought to be because of the blood-red color of the planet which was also used by other ancient cultures.
                         Chinese astronomers call Mars the “fire star” while ancient Egyptian priests called it “Her Desher” meaning 
                         “the red one”.</li>
                    <li>The landmass of Mars and Earth is very similar. Despite Mars being just 15% the volume and 10% the mass of Earth,
                         it actually has a similar landmass because water covers about 70% of Earth’s surface. The surface gravity of 
                         Mars is about 37% the gravity found on Earth. This means that on Mars you could in theory jump 3x higher than 
                         you could on Earth.</li>
                    <li>Only 16 of the 39 Mars missions have been successful. Beginning with the USSR’s Marsnik 1 which was launched
                         in 1960, 39 orbiters, landers and rovers have been to Mars but only 16 of those missions were a success. 
                         In 2016, Europe’s Exobiology on Mars program will search the planet for signs of Martian life as well as 
                         study the surface and terrain of the planet and map potential environmental hazards to future manned missions 
                         to Mars.</li>
                    <li>Pieces of Mars have been found on Earth. It is believed that trace amounts of the Martian atmosphere were within
                         meteorites that the planet ejected. These meteorites then orbited the solar system for millions of years 
                         amongst the other objects and solar debris before eventually entering the Earth’s atmosphere and crashing 
                         to the ground. The study of this material has allowed scientists to discover more about Mars before launching 
                         space missions.</li>
                    <li>Mars was once believed to be home to intelligent life. This came from the discovery of lines or grooves 
                        in the surface called canali by Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli. He believed that these were not 
                        naturally occurring and were proof of intelligent life. However, these were later shown to be an optical 
                        illusion.</li>
                    <li>The tallest mountain known in the solar system is on Mars. Olympus Mons is a 21 km high and 600 km diameter
                         shield volcano that was formed billions of years ago. Scientists have found a lot of recent evidence of 
                         volcanic lava which suggests Olympus Mons may still be active. It is the second highest mountain in the 
                         entire solar system, topped only by the Rheasilvia central peak on the asteroid Vesta, which is 22 km high.</li>
                    <li>Mars experiences huge dust storms – the largest in our solar system. This is due to the elliptical shape
                         of the planet’s orbit path around the Sun. The orbit path is more elongated than many of the other planets
                          and this oval shaped orbit results in fierce dust storms that cover the entire planet and can last for 
                          many months.</li>
                </ul>
